# BMSSP_CPP

C++11 reference implementation of the **Bounded Multi-Source Shortest Path (BMSSP)** algorithm from  
[*Breaking the Sorting Barrier for Directed Single-Source Shortest Paths*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17033).

## üöÄ About this Project

This repository provides a **from-scratch implementation** of BMSSP in **one C++11 file**, capable of reading weighted directed graphs from `.dot` files and computing approximate shortest paths.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This code was created with the help of [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/68a38505-bc8c-8010-8a36-9586d2a481a7) and is open for:
- Corrections  
- Testing  
- Benchmarking  
- Collaboration  

It is not yet optimized for production use, but aims to be a faithful educational implementation closely referencing the original paper.

## üõ† Compilation

You need a **C++11 or later** compiler.

```bash
gcc -O2 bmssp.c -o bmssp
````

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running

The program expects a `.dot` file containing a directed graph with edge weights encoded as `label="w"`.

```bash
./bmssp <file.dot> <source_label> [dest_label]
```

Example output:

```
> bmssp.exe sample_big.dot N0
Source: N0

To N0: dist=0  path=N0
To N1: dist=4  path=N0 -> N1
To N2: dist=11  path=N0 -> N1 -> N2
To N3: dist=14  path=N0 -> N1 -> N2 -> N3
To N4: dist=20  path=N0 -> N1 -> N2 -> N3 -> N4
To N5: dist=7  path=N0 -> N5
To N6: dist=15  path=N0 -> N5 -> N6
To N7: dist=17  path=N0 -> N5 -> N6 -> N7
To N8: dist=26  path=N0 -> N5 -> N6 -> N7 -> N8
To N9: dist=30  path=N0 -> N5 -> N6 -> N7 -> N8 -> N9
To N10: dist=17  path=N0 -> N5 -> N10
...
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hyperparameters

* **t**: recursion depth, set adaptively ‚âà `(log2(n))^(2/3)`
* **k**: frontier breadth, set adaptively ‚âà `(log2(n))^(1/3)`

These scale automatically with graph size to balance performance and completeness.
